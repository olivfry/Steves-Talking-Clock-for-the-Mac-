## 1 - Introduction
Welcome to **Steve's Talking Clock**, a small, customisable talking clock for Mac! This program lives in the Mac system tray (Menu Bar) and can be configured to automatically announce the time on the quarter-hour, half-hour, three-quarters, and at the top of the hour. 

### Key Features:
* Configurable 15-minute announcement timers.
* Customisable alarm for any time of day.
* Support for multiple voice types and audio output selection.
* Dedicated to my friends: Ellis, Joseph, George, Manuel, and Harlee.

## 2 - Installation
To install Steve's Talking Clock onto your computer:
1. Go to the main GitHub page.
2. Click the **Releases** section on the right.
3. Download the `v1.1` ZIP file.
4. Move the `.app` file to your **Applications** folder.

To obtain voice packs, visit the home page at [http://clock.steve-audio.net](http://clock.steve-audio.net).

## 3 - General Overview
When you first run the clock, it will open a window with voice settings. You can use the **Tab** key to navigate.
1. **Main Voice List**: Controls the 'Speak Time' button.
2. **Quarter Hour Voice List**: Announces at the 15-minute mark.
3. **24 Hour Mode**: Toggle using the checkbox.
4. **Minimise to Tray**: Use the button or **Alt+M** to move the clock to the Menu Bar.

## 4 - The Alarm
To set the alarm, use the following format:
* **12-hour**: `hh:mm am/pm` (e.g., `03:12 am`)
* **24-hour**: `hh:mm` (e.g., `22:47`)

## 5 - Audio Configuration
Click the **AirPlay** button on the right edge of the window to select your output device (e.g., Headphones or System Speakers).

## 7 - Quiet Mode
Set a "Stop" and "Start" time to keep the clock silent during the night or while you are working. For example, setting 11:00 pm to 06:00 am will keep Steve quiet while you sleep!

## 14 - Credits and Final Notes
I would like to thank **Stephen Clower** for the inspiration, as well as **Andre Louis** and **Patrick Perdue** for their original work and voice packs. 

**Happy Ticking!**
